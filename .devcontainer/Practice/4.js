/* 
Double equals (==) is often referred to as 'loose equality' because it performs type coercion before making any comparison.
This means that if the datatypes of the operands we are comparing are different, then the JavaScript Engine automatically
converts one of the operands to be the same as the other one in order to make the comparison possible.
*/

/*
While comparing the variables, it first checks if the types differ. If they do, it returns false. 
If the types match, then it checks for the value. If the values are same and are not numbers, it returns true
